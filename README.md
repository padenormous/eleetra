# Elyeetra

Min/Max Your Rocket Stack! A Minecraft mod that both enhances and nerfs Elytra rocket boosting by allowing multiple rockets to be used at once but also makes single rockets barely enough to get you off the ground.

## Features

- **Multi-Rocket Boost**: Hold shift and right-click to use entire stack of rockets at once for massive speed boost
- **Detailed HUD**: Shows important flight metrics including:
  - Current and max speed
  - Maximum acceleration
  - G-forces
  - Current coordinates
  - Distance traveled
  - Flight direction
- **Physics-Based Boost**: Uses enhanced physics for better flight mechanics

## Usage

1. Equip an Elytra and get some firework rockets
2. Take off and start gliding
3. For normal boost: Right-click with rockets (single rocket provides gentle lift)
4. For super boost: Hold shift + right-click to use entire stack at once!

## Rocket Stack Mechanics

The mod uses an exponential boost system:
- **1-7 rockets**: Provides modest speed boosts, 2-3 m/s
- **8+ rockets**: Physics manipulation kicks in, dramatically increasing your speed
- **32 rockets**: Achieve speeds over 150 m/s!
- **64 rockets**: Prepare for extreme velocities exceeding 200 m/s!

Pro tip: Start with smaller stacks (8-16 rockets) to get a feel for the boost mechanics before attempting full stack launches.

## Flight HUD

The included HUD provides real-time flight metrics with a semi-transparent background for better visibility. Track your:
- Current and maximum speeds
- Maximum acceleration achieved
- G-forces experienced during flight
- Exact coordinates
- Total distance traveled from launch point
- Cardinal direction

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- Fabric Loader >=0.15.0
- Fabric API
- Java 21 or higher

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader and Fabric API
2. Download the mod from Modrinth
3. Place the .jar file in your mods folder
4. Launch Minecraft and enjoy!

## Safety Notes

- At high speeds, make sure your render distance is high enough to let chunks load
- Watch your altitude when testing large rocket stacks
- Keep an eye on the Distance Traveled metric to avoid getting lost
